# Log Parsing Project

This project consists of two Python scripts that work together to parse log data and compute statistics.

## 0-generator.py

This script generates sample log data and outputs it to the standard output. It simulates log entries for IP addresses, dates, HTTP methods, status codes, and file sizes.

Usage:
```sh
./0-generator.py
